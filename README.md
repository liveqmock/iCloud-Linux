Goals:

Provide intergration with Linux desktop environment's such as GNOME, KDE, and Mate Desktop.
Be simple to implement and easy to understand.
Be very well written, in other words be high quality (Like Apple :p)
Provide basic support for windows. (Apple officially supports using iCloud on windows themselves)
