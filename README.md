This library is the first of several peices of software currently being written (Unofficially) to provide first iCloud support to Linux in the first place and then with future development will provide integration for all you iCloud data.

Goals:

Provide basic iCloud support for Linux via the servers that iCloud.com uses.
Provide intergration with Linux desktop environment's such as GNOME, KDE, and Mate Desktop.
Be simple to implement and easy to understand.
Be very well written, in other words be high quality (Like Apple :p)
